# BURAK

BURAK is a TypeScript web application built with Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It includes EJS-rendered restaurant pages and JSON endpoints for member signup and login.

## Features

- Member signup and login endpoints
- Password hashing with `bcryptjs`
- MongoDB persistence through Mongoose
- EJS pages for the restaurant/admin flow
- Static assets served from `public/`

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- A MongoDB connection string

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/burak
PORT=3000
```

Replace `MONGO_URL` with your MongoDB connection string. `PORT` is optional; the app uses `3000` when it is not set.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run it without the file watcher:

```bash
npm start
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:3000`. The restaurant/admin pages are served under `/admin`.
